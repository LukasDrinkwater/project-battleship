// TOP says create ship objects
// Properties - hit count/hp, lenpropertygth, if they are sunk
// Method hit() that ++ the hit count
// Method isSunk() that calculates it based off the length and number of hits.

// Class function that makes the gameboard
// Need to then make 2 boards, 1 for each player
// Properties - player, status for each type of ship, ship hp,
// Method that gets called when a ship is hit and takes 1 hp off the ship type
// Method instead of the above maybe, receiveAttack() function that takes a pair of
// coordinates and if it hits a ship, also records the coordinates of a missed ship

// Might not have to use the node/square class if i do all the above methods in
// the gameboard class. Dont need to create a node/square for each coordinate. Just
// need to see if the coordinates match some cordinates attached to a ship object.
// Class for the node/squares
// Preporties - ship type, if square is hit, row, col
// Method that changes a squares hit status then calls the Method from the
// correct players gameboard to take 1 hp off the ship type

// create Player class?
// 1 or 2? or just have a property that says whos turn it is

// computer, get it to pick a random square??????????

// MAIN GAME LOOP
// needs a user interface showing both players boards, ships on the boards
// To attack, user needs to click on a coordinate in the enemy gameboard
// can use data type to have the correct coordinates.
// TOP says to only use methods in the objects for the game loop
